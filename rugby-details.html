                            Rugby football refers to the team sports rugby league or rugby union. Rugby union originated at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire. Rugby league originated fromrugby union but in 1895 in Huddersfield, Northern England, when twenty one clubs split to form the Northern Rugby Football Union.
                            This is today called the Rugby Football League which is governedby the English Rugby League. The Rugby Football Union governs English Rugby Union. Rugby footballis one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used 
                            rugby union rules, they are now wholly seperate sports. In addition to the two existing codes, both codes of gridiron football have evolved from rugby football.

                            The origin of rugby football is reputed to be incident during a game of English School Football at rugby school in 1823, when William Webb Ellis is said to have picked up the ball and run with it. Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a plaque
                            unveiled in 1895. Despite the doubtful evidence, the Rugby Worldcup Trophy is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby school, which former pupils then introducedto their university. Old Rugbeian Albert pell, a student at Cambridge, is credited with having 
                            formed the first "football" team. During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preffered rules  through to their university.

                            The first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England in Edinburgh. Scotland won the game 1-0. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun. 1883
                            is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournment, the Melrose Sevens which is still held annually. Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a British Isles team visited Australia and New Zealand- although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future British and Irish
                            Lions tours; and the 1888-89 New Zealand Native football team brought the first overseas team to british spectators.

                            Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field and seven or eight substitutes. Players in a team are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball. Players in these positions
                            are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out. The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation. The front row consists of three players: two props and the hooker. The role of the two props is to
                            support hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. the hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning
                            the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw ball in at line-outs.

                            The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline and the service line. The Short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that makeup the length are the doubles sidelines. These
                            are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in single play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which
                            is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not
                            where a player legally stands when making a serve.

                            A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won atleast four points in total and atleast two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described ina manner peculiar to tennis: scores
                            from zero to three points are described as "Love", "15", "30", "40", respectively. If atleast three points have been scored by each player, making the player's equal to 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40-40", but rather as "deuce". If atleast three points have been scored
                            by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead. during informal games, "advantage" can also be called as "ad in" or "van in" when the serving player is ahead , and "ad out" or "van out" when the receiving
                            player is ahead.
