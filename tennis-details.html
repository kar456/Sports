                            Historicans believe that the game's ancient lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was keen player of "jeu de paume", which evolved into real tennis and became notable as the first person to construct indoor
                            tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal places all over europe. In june 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de
                            Marne and following a particularly exhausting game. Because of the contemporary of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was the king Charles V of france, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.
                            Further, the patenting of the first lawn mover in 1830, in Birtain is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, forthe preparation of morn-style grass courts, sporting layouts, playing fields, pitches, greens etc., . This in turn led to the codification of modern rules
                            for many sports, including Lawn-tennis, most football codes , lawn bowls and others.

                           Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem, a solicitor and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the basque ball game pelote, which they on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham, England, UK. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's 
                            first tennis club on Avenue road, Leamington Spa. This is were "Lawn tennis" is used as a name of activity by a club for the first time. After Leamington, the second club to take up the game of lawn tennis appears to have been in Edgebaston Archery and Croquet Society, also in Birmingham.

                            On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions . The US National Men's Singles Championship , now the US Open , was first held in 1881
                            at the Newport Casino , Newport, Rhode island . The US National Womens Single's Championship were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.

                            Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77m) long, and 27 feet (8.2m) wide for singles matches and 36ft (11m) for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls . A net is
                            strectched across full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can be no more than 0.8cm. the net is 3 feet 6 inches high at the posts and 3 feet high in the center. The net posts are
                            3 feet outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, 3 feet outside the singles court on each side.

                            The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline and the service line. The Short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that makeup the length are the doubles sidelines. These 
                            are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in single play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which
                            is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not
                            where a player legally stands when making a serve.

                            A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won atleast four points in total and atleast two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described ina manner peculiar to tennis: scores
                            from zero to three points are described as "Love", "15", "30", "40", respectively. If atleast three points have been scored by each player, making the player's equal to 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40-40", but rather as "deuce". If atleast three points have been scored
                            by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead. during informal games, "advantage" can also be called as "ad in" or "van in" when the serving player is ahead , and "ad out" or "van out" when the receiving
                            player is ahead.
