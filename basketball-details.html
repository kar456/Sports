                            In early december 1891, Canadian James Naismith , a physical education professor and instructor at the international young men's christians association Training school in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym
                            class active on a rainy day. He sought vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums
                            he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot elevated track. In contrast with the modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom , and the balls had to be rerieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this
                            proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.

                            Basketball was originally played with soccer ball. These round balls from "association football" were made at the time with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the balls
                            cover had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this chnage to the game was endrosed by Naismith. The first balls made specifically for
                            for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950's that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except
                            for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primarymeans of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around 1950 as manufacturing improved the
                            ball shape.

                            At the time, football was being played with 10 to a team(which now has increased to 11). When winter weather got too icy to play football, teams taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897-1898
                            teams of five became standard.

                            The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponent's basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth of
                            two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-pont arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches(7.24 m) in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after
                            foul is made. Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations.
